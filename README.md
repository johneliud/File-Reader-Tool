## About The Project
This tool simplifies the process of reading and copying the contents from one file to another and is a lightweight utility. It offers a straightforward solution for file manipulation.

## Built With
Go programming language also known as Golang was the technology used to build this tool. Below are a few reasons as to why Golang was settled on:
- Lightweight
- Standard library
- Efficiency

## Getting Started
To have the program running in your local environment, you will need to have Go programming language installed. Click on the link below to install Golang:

### Installation
Follow the steps below using terminal commands to install the project on your local environment:
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/johneliud/file-reader-tool.git
```
2. Change path to the cloned directory
```
cd file-reader-tool
```

## Usage
Running the program is super easy. Take note of the instruction below
- You have to define three commands when running the program from the terminal
1. File to be executed
2. File to read from
3. File to written
```
go run . input-file.txt output-file.txt
```
The program is expected to display an error if the number of arguments passed to it is not three. By running the above command, contents of input-file.txt will be read, copied and written to a new file specified as output-file.txt.
